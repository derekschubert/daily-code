# Daily Code
### Daily code challenge solutions &amp;&amp; mock-ups

_Note: These challenges are either from various online sources (ie: dailycodingchallenges.com / leetcode.com / etc) or some problem that I want to figure out personally._

Officially started on Nov 4, 2019 (daily habit made public as a way to push some things to Github ;))

- Day 1: Find all different rectangles in a 2d grid, including diagonals. Some points may be missing.
  - source: [Cl√©ment Mihailescu on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuPSibuIKIg)
  - solution: [day-1-rectanglesInGrid.js](day-1-rectanglesInGrid.js)

- Day 2: Add two numbers (each represented in a reverse-order linked list) and return it as a linked list.
  - source: [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers/)
  - solution: [day-2-addTwoNumbersInLinkedList.go](day-2-addTwoNumbersInLinkedList.go)

- Day 3: Do any two numbers in a given list add up to equal value k? (determined in O(n) time)
  - source: [Daily Coding Problem](https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/) (problem by Google)
  - solution: [day-3-doTwoNumbersAddUpToK](day-3-doTwoNumbersAddUpToK.go) (two solutions based on an input of either a sorted or unsorted list)

- Day 4: Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i
  - source: [Daily Coding Problem](https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/) (problem by Uber)
  - solution: [day-4-productOfAllButSelf](day-4-productOfAllButSelf.go) (3 solutions: with division & w/o division)

- Day 5: Given the root to a binary tree, implement serialize(root), which serializes the tree into a string, and deserialize(s), which deserializes the string back into the tree.
  - source: [Daily Coding Problem](https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/) (problem by Google)
  - solution: [day-5-serializeBinarySearchTree](day-5-serializeBinarySearchTree.js)

- Day 6: Given an array of integers, find the first missing positive integer.
  - source: [Daily Coding Problem (starting to see a trend here...)](https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/) (problem by Stripe)
  - solution: [day-6-findLowestMissingPositiveInteger](day-6-findLowestMissingPositiveInteger.go)
  
- Day 7: Merge k sorted linked lists and return it as one sorted list.
  - source: [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-k-sorted-lists/)
  - solution: [day-7-mergeKLinkedLists](day-7-mergeKLinkedLists.go)

- Day 8: Find how much water would be trapped given an array of heights (each index representing an equal width)
  - source: [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/trapping-rain-water/)
  - solution: [day-8-trappedWater](day-8-trappedWater.go)

- Day 9: Given the mapping a = 1, b = 2, ... z = 26, and an encoded message, count the number of ways it can be decoded - assuming all messages are decodable (ie: 001 not allowed)
  - source: [Daily Coding Problem](https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/) (problem by Facebook)
  - solution: [day-9-decodeNumbers](day-9-decodeNumbers.go)

- Day 10: Given n non-negative integers where each integer represents a point at coordinate (index, int), n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.
  - source: [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/container-with-most-water/)
  - solution: [day-10-maxWater](day-10-maxWater.go)

- Day 11: Given a list of integers, write a function that returns the largest sum of non-adjacent numbers. Numbers can be 0 or negative.
  - source: [Daily Coding Problem](https://www.dailycodingproblem.com/) (problem by Airbnb)
  - solution: [day-11-largestSumOfNonAdjacentNumbers](day-11-largestSumOfNonAdjacentNumbers.go) (2 solutions - dynamic (very fast) & recursive)
